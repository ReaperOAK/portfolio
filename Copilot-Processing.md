# Copilot Processing Status

## User Request
Follow the TODO list in `planning and docs\TODO.md`, check what's already been done, complete remaining tasks, and keep the TODO updated throughout the process.

## Current Analysis
The TODO.md shows a comprehensive list with many frontend tasks marked as complete, but several key areas remain:

### High Priority Incomplete Tasks:
1. **Contact Form Backend** - Critical for MVP completion
2. **Performance & SEO optimizations** - Essential for production
3. **Testing & QA** - Quality assurance
4. **Deployment preparation** - Launch readiness
5. **Open source documentation** - Professional presentation

### Areas to Investigate:
- Contact page backend implementation status
- Current build/deployment configuration
- Performance optimization status
- Documentation completeness

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Infrastructure
- [ ] Contact form backend (Firebase Functions with Nodemailer)
- [ ] Environment variables setup for client
- [ ] Firebase hosting configuration fix (pointing to correct build directory)
- [ ] Backend package.json and dependencies

### Phase 2: Performance & SEO
- [ ] Dynamic meta tags (React Helmet)
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] sitemap.xml and robots.txt
- [ ] Lighthouse audit and fixes

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for key components
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] README.md updates
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] LICENSE file
- [ ] Deployment configuration
